[IBM's New Software Will Make Quantum Programs Run 100 Times Faster](https://singularityhub.com/2021/02/15/ibms-new-software-will-make-quantum-programs-run-100-times-faster/)
## My Thoughts
I found this article interesting because it discusses IBM's plans to develop quantum computing software. Quantum computing is the future of the tech industry and it has seen a lot of progress recently. IBM plans to expedite the process further by making their project open-source and allowing many developers to collaborate in developing software to control the hardware. They estimate that by 2023, developers will be able work on quantum software without really having to understand the physics behind quantum hardware and by 2025 quantum processes will be widely used. It's exciting to know that we, as developers, will probably be creating and using quantum software in the near future.

## Daniel Tomkovicz's Comment
Was interesting to read about this because the last time I was semi-aware of quantum computing, I imagined it was super niche and not going to reach mainstream, at least not for a while. Scary how quickly technology moves forward these days and it is estimated to be widespread in a couple of years!
