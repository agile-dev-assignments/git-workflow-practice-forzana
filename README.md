[IBM's New Software Will Make Quantum Programs Run 100 Times Faster](https://singularityhub.com/2021/02/15/ibms-new-software-will-make-quantum-programs-run-100-times-faster/)
## My Thoughts
I found this article interesting because it discusses IBM's plans to develop quantum computing software. Quantum computing is the future of the tech industry and it has seen a lot of progress recently. IBM plans to expedite the process further by making their project open-source and allowing many developers to collaborate in developing software to control the hardware. They estimate that by 2023, developers will be able work on quantum software without really having to understand the physics behind quantum hardware and by 2025 quantum processes will be widely used. It's exciting to know that we, as developers, will probably be creating and using quantum software in the near future.

## Crystal's Edits
This article caught my attention because in one of my classes, we recently talked about Moore's law, where it states that processor speeds, or overall processing power for computers will double every two years. The article touches on that topic, where it talks about quantum computers have made significant process in recent years. I thought it was cool to see insight in a million dollar industry even though quantum computers are at its early stages.
